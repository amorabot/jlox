## What is Lox?
-----------------------------
Lox is a simple scripting language crated by Robert Nystom in his book, [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)

There, he goes into detail about key concepts regarding programming languages and how to implement them first hand, if needed.

jlox is the implementation of the language's interpreter using Java as its foundation. This implementation covers only a basic approach to some features the language might need.
clox is the more efficient, versitile and feature-heavy implementation in C.

## Why create this repository?

Since Robert covers, quite literally, every line of code on this repo., my aim is to provide some extra insight into the code's funcionality from a student's perspective. Due to size limitations, the Book is heavily constrained on what it can and cannot explicitly cover and explain.
Because of this, as I discover and experiment with Lox's features I plan to document my studies and provide extra guidance to any fortunate soul that happens to stumble on this repo's implementation.

## Below are some personal notes and a link to a Notion page containing additional context/notes.
